# Matlab demo of Multilayer Perceptron
Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) is a basic deep neural network model, usually for the purpose of classification.

I developed a Matlab demo of MLP, which can be a guide for beginners. This code will mainly tell you how to pretrain by stacked sparse autoencoder, finetune with back propagation algorithm and predict using feedforward pass. 

This demo take the MNIST handwritten digits recognition as an example (the setting in demo.m can obtain a classification accuracy ), and you can modify this code for other datasets.
